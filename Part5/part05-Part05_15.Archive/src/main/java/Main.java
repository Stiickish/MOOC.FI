    Part 1.
    The program should read items from the user. When all the items from the user
    have been read, the program prints the information of each item.
    
    For each item, its' identificer and name should be read. If the identificer
    or name is empty, the program stops asking for input, and prints 
    all the item information. 
    
    Part 2.
    Modify the program so that after entering the items, each item is printed
    at most once. Two items should be considered the same if their identifiers are
    the same (there can be variation in their names in different countries, for instance)
    
    If the user enters the same item multiple times, the print uses the item that was
    added first.
